# T4 : Key Partners and Website Design

Team Leader:

# Business Partners
* The local banks in Africa would be our main business parner. 
* We would want to stay local for a server hosting site.
* Amazon for a place for people to purchase from.
* Any other online or physical retail space in which our cards are used. 

## How our Partners Help
  
 * The banks would provide us the money and basic platform for our cards to use. They would hand out/sell our cards.
 * The server site will host our website along with user information.
 * Amazon provides us with their catalog.
