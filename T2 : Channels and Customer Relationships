Ideas for connecting with customers

How do you raise customer awareness? How can customers evaluate your offerings? 

  Africa doesn't have many businesses like us, so we would sort of be a monopoly for a while. We will have advertisement
  campaigns to promote our business and raise awareness. Providing cards to buy things online is a modern day necessity. 

How do they purchase from you? How do you deliver value? How do you provide support?

  We would partner with local banks so they will provide our cards to the people. We would provide 24/7 support lines and mail. 
  Our main goal is to provide the cards so that things can be bought online in a quick and orderly manner.

Then describe how you would maintain customer relationships with your customer segments. 

  We would gain feeback from our custormers in the form of a survey of some sorts. Start a mailing list to let our custormers
  know what's going on.

What type of relationship do your customers expect from your organization?

  We want a professional relationship where we can trust the card owners and the card owners can trust us.

Can you use these relationships to acquire, retain, and upsell customer segments? 

  Yes, we can acquire customers as the country develops, because we would have been there for a while so we would have
  brand power. The more customers we can get, the more we can provide and the more successful our business can be.

Consider direct personal assistance (either online or in person), self-service, automated services, user communities, etc.
While describing these approaches to interacting with your customer segments, make sure that they fit clearly within your business idea.

  We would have phone centers, a mail center, and 24/7 online support to maximize support. We need everyone to understand
  what we provide and how we can help them.
