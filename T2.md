# T2 : Channels and Customer Relationships
Team leader - Nate Andres

## Channels
Africa doesn't have many businesses like us, so we will sort of be a monopoly for a while. Providing credit cards to buy things online is a modern day necessity. Customer awareness would sort of spread by word of mouth as we are the only company offering the product. They will evaluate our products through their normal banks that they have been using. We can work with local TV stations and broadcasting in order to motivate our costomers with maximum information, and providing more advitersing can help spread our business as well. We would work with banks so we would be bought from a bank. We would provide 24/7 support lines and mail. Our main goal is to provide the cards so that things can be bought online in a quick and orderly manner. Value is provided because they currently can't buy things online efficiently and we would be the first company to give our customers that ability.

## Customer Relationships
We want a professional relationship where we can trust the card owners and the card owners can trust us. They just want us to give them a quality product that works as advertised. We will gain feeback from our custormers in the form of a survey, and we will start a mailing list to let our custormers know what's going on. We would also gain feedback through our partner banks, if customers come to them with an issue they could relay the information to us. We can acquire customers as countries develop because we would have been there for a while, so we would have brand power. The more customers we can get, the more we can provide. We deliver quality, reliable products and our customers will reward us with their continued business. We would have phone centers, a mail center, and 24/7 online support to maximize support. We need everyone to understand what we provide and how we can help them.
