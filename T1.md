# T1 : Business Opportunity & Market Feasibility
Team Leader: Brody Himmelberg

## Business Idea & Customers
Next Generation is a credit card software company that partners with local banks in Africa. Our goal is to provide online software and banking accessibility to developing countries in Africa. People in Africa can't purchase things online because they don't have access to credit cards. We would provide that service to allow them to make online purchases. Individuals in a developing country tend to have higher risk to lines of credit, and this risk has been taken into account through our value proposition and goals.

## Value Propositions
The value that we hope to bring to customers is the security to use credit cards in a developing country, as well as the luxury of a secure and reliable online website and software. As a credit card company, our main product is to provide a line of credit to individuals that is to be repaid monthly, where interest is charged if debt is not repaid. Additional products that we will have available as part of our business plan include credit and account monitoring, communication with local banks, and security of sensitive information.
 
## Goals
Our goal over the next 5 years as a for-profit business is to start small and expand across Africa to provide credit card services to those who do not have it. We will partner with a local manufacturer to get cards, and we will also partner with a growing array of banks to estabilish and expand our services. As a partnership, banks will pay us for software and a percentage of each transaction.
