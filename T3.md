## Key Resources


/**
First identify the key activities for creating your value propositions. Will you be developing physical or digital products? 
Will you be solving customer problems? Will you develop and maintain a platform for customers to use?
-We will develop and maintain an online platform for people in Africa to buy products online. Our physical cards are bought from the banks 
that we are partnered with. 
-We will be solving the problem of online shopping in Africa.

Next list the key resources required to make your business model work. Consider physical, intellectual, human, and financial assets. 
Identify whether you would own these resources, rent or lease them, or acquire them through business partners.
-We would need a database server which could be bought. We need the banks to partner with us to provide our cards. 


A key resource for an online business is its use of technology. Consider hardware, software, databases, and data communications. 
Based on this, develop the Information Technology Platform: a description of the computing and communications equipment and software 
your new organization needs to operate. 
This includes not only the equipment for the website, but also the technology to run the business processes and the business administration.
-A database to hold customer information. A web server to hold our website that makes only shopping simple. We need powerful servers to handle our customers.


Ensure that the activities and resources fit your customer segments, value propositions, channels, and customer relationships.
-Our partnership with banks provides us with money. The customers are still the number one priority so our relationship should still be good.
